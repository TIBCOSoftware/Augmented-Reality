To meet today’s information-interaction challenges, companies are starting to build augmented reality (AR/XR) experiences. Use cases are varied, but often fall into three categories:

- Customer experience (common examples include advertising, product guidance, and gaming)
- Training (for specific physical tasks like equipment maintenance)
- Productivity (for actions that can be assisted by virtual information like walking through a museum, reacting in an emergency, or finding the fastest route through the airport)

In all cases, and especially for training and productivity-related scenarios, AR/XR allows both historical and real-time enterprise data to be delivered, consumed and presented to the user in new ways that increase the value of the data. Information may be displayed as holograms to enrich the real environment, and all this is completely and automatically handsfree, and can even include voice control.

To showcase the possibilities, TIBCO LABS is exploring and demonstrating how TIBCO Cloud™ capabilities can facilitate and simplify building AR/XR applications. By seamlessly integrating enterprise data into AR/XR scenarios, users can be immersed in rich, fun, and highly relevant interactive experiences.

This developer documentation for TIBCO LABS™ Project ART contains all the information you need to understand and successfully use this project assets.
