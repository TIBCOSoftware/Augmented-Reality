In the MainController, you can update the Connection property prefix (default is \u0026ldquo;liveapps\u0026rdquo;). It is used to read properties in the credential file :\nthe credentials must be declared in a file named \u0026ldquo;TIBCO-credentials.txt\u0026rdquo; and placed in a Resources folder. For example in TIBCOLabs \u0026gt; Utils \u0026gt; Resources.\nThe file must contain [prefix].username, [prefix].password and [prefix].clientid with the values from your TIBCO Cloud™ Subscription Details\nThe package contains a sample credential file for you to copy.\nOn the script BoardViewController.cs attached to the main controller check that \u0026ldquo;LiveApps App Name\u0026rdquo; matches the name of the LiveApps application you have created. The default is \u0026ldquo;Info Card\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen playing the BoardScene in unity Editor, you should see the data retrieved from LiveApps application in the form of cards :\nTIBCO LiveApps cases in Unity Editor\nThe sample application is creating a Card for \u0026ldquo;ant\u0026rdquo; if the card does not exist so you can see how to create LiveApps cases and attach documents.\nAPI details connection to LiveApps Just add TIBCOLiveAppsConnector script in your scene and set the credentials to be connected to your LiveApps instance.\nCreate a controller script by extending \u0026ldquo;TIBCOLiveAppsHandler\u0026rdquo;. Have a look at the sample BoardViewController.\nConnectionReady is invoke when the connector successfully connects to LiveApps.\nThe connector object has the following public methods :\nread LiveApps cases  public void GetAllCases(string applicationName, string stateName, string searchString, bool getArtifacts = false, Action onComplete=null)\n To get a list all cases in a LiveApps application,\n in the given state if state is not null. matching the searchString if not null  Use either a state or a searchString but not both.\nretrieveDocuments : true to get artifacts ie documents and images associated with the cases.\nThe implementation is asynchronous and will call the onComplete callback on completion. The callback has a parameter of type CaseInfoWrapper holding the cases.\nYou may check the structures in TIBCOLiveAppsConnector.cs\nTo Manipulate the case data easily create a class representing the LiveApps case information. in our example we are using :\npublic class ElementData\r{\rpublic string Name;\rpublic string Description;\rpublic UnityEngine.Texture2D texture;\r}\r We have the 2 fields from LiveApps application and we have added a texture to store the first document of type image.\nIn the OnCase callback you can create instances from the CaseInfoWrapper data :\nforeach (CaseInfo item in data.items) {\rElementData card = JsonUtility.FromJson\u0026lt;ElementData\u0026gt;(item.casedata);\r...\r create a LiveApps case  public void CreateCase(string applicationName, System.Object data, string creatorName = null, Action onComplete = null)\n See the sample on how to create the data object.\nIf the creatorName is null, the connector will use the first creator.\nThe onComplete callback has an ActionResponse parameter.\nattach a document to an existing case instance  public void AttachDocument(string caseReference, string documentName, string description, byte[] data, string mimeType,Action onComplete=null)\n Target Devices Tested with Microsoft Hololens, Android Smartphones and Unity Editor on Windows 10.\nUsed Versions  Unity (2019.4.10f1) Unity AR Foundations (3.1.0) Unity AR Subsystem (3.1.0) Unity ARCore XR Plugin (3.1.0) Android 10 Google Pixel XL Microsoft Hololens V2  Content git repositories :\n Package Source  ","excerpt":"The Implementation leverages TIBCO Cloud™ and TIBCO Cloud™ LiveApp REST APIs.

Use cases are varied, but often fall into three categories:\n Customer experience (common examples include advertising, product guidance, and gaming) Training (for specific physical tasks like equipment maintenance) Productivity (for actions that can be assisted by virtual information like walking through a museum, reacting in an emergency, or finding the fastest route through the airport)  In all cases, and especially for training and productivity-related scenarios, AR/XR allows both historical and real-time enterprise data to be delivered, consumed and presented to the user in new ways that increase the value of the data. Information may be displayed as holograms to enrich the real environment, and all this is completely and automatically handsfree, and can even include voice control.\nTo showcase the possibilities, TIBCO LABS is exploring and demonstrating how TIBCO Cloud™ capabilities can facilitate and simplify building AR/XR applications. By seamlessly integrating enterprise data into AR/XR scenarios, users can be immersed in rich, fun, and highly relevant interactive experiences.\nThis developer documentation for TIBCO LABS™ Project ART contains all the information you need to understand and successfully use this project assets.\n","excerpt":"To meet today’s information-interaction challenges, companies are starting to build augmented …","ref":"https://tibcosoftware.github.io/Augmented-Reality/docs/","title":"Documentation"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://tibcosoftware.github.io/Augmented-Reality/docs/explorations/","title":"Explorations"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://tibcosoftware.github.io/Augmented-Reality/blog/releases/","title":"New Releases"},{"body":"adding TIBCO Cloud Nimbus Augmented Reality Exploration\n based on Hololens 2 connected to TIBCO Cloud Services.\n ","excerpt":"adding TIBCO Cloud Nimbus Augmented Reality Exploration\n based on Hololens 2 connected to TIBCO …","ref":"https://tibcosoftware.github.io/Augmented-Reality/blog/2020/10/08/nimbus-exploration/","title":"Nimbus Exploration"},{"body":"Augmented Reality without a special Devices and a native App is possible today.\nCheck out or latest LABS Demo Implemenation called ARTwalker\n AR with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript, connected to TIBCO Cloud Services.\n ","excerpt":"Augmented Reality without a special Devices and a native App is possible today.\nCheck out or latest …","ref":"https://tibcosoftware.github.io/Augmented-Reality/blog/2020/09/28/webxr-exploration/","title":"WebXR Exploration"},{"body":"third public Implementation Packages for Unity of the TIBCO LABS™ Project ART, containing:\n add browse cases incl. attachments, implementation to TIBCO Cloud™ Live Apps - Unity3D Package work in progress details about upcoming Unity3D Package  We are glad having in the meantime three Hololens V2 devices.\nNext, we started to work with WebXR as well, to support all kind Devices near future.\n please have a look back soon here, and check our Roadmap.\n ","excerpt":"third public Implementation Packages for Unity of the TIBCO LABS™ Project ART, containing:\n add …","ref":"https://tibcosoftware.github.io/Augmented-Reality/blog/2020/09/25/3nd-september-release/","title":"3nd September Release"},{"body":"second public Implementation Packages for Unity of the TIBCO LABS™ Project ART, containing:\n add publish messages sample implementation to TIBCO Cloud™ Messaging - Unity3D Package add Hololens 2 Sample Implementation Unity Project for TIBCO Cloud™ Messaging   please have a look back soon here, and check our Roadmap.\n ","excerpt":"second public Implementation Packages for Unity of the TIBCO LABS™ Project ART, containing:\n add …","ref":"https://tibcosoftware.github.io/Augmented-Reality/blog/2020/04/27/2nd-april-release/","title":"2nd April Release"},{"body":"first public Implementation Packages for Unity of the TIBCO LABS™ Project ART, containing:\n TIBCO Logo Package. 3D Charts, that can be used in AR Implementations for Hololens and ARCore.
