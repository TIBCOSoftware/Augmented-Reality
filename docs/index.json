Just enter\n set color red set color blue set color green  It is a sample application, so we have implemented a very simple, text based set of commands. The sample can be extended to implement solutions using elaborated JSON messages.\nA panel in the Scene is also displaying received messages.\nInstall  Open the project in Unity 2019.2.17f1 Import MRTK 2.3.0 foundation Import TIBCOFTL Package (from this repository under Packages folder) Set your Credentials  You can test in Unity Editor.\nDeploy on Hololens and enjoy.\nSet credentials\nFor security reasons, credential are stored as property keys in a resource file named TIBCO-credentials.txt which is ignored from git so credentials are not checked in.\nThe directory TIBCOLabs \u0026gt; Utils \u0026gt; Resources contains a sample resource file. You can copy it with a the correct name or just create TIBCO-credentials.txt resource and have the following lines :\n eftl.socketurl = Web Socket URI eftl.authkey = your authentication key  Prerequisite\nGet a TIBCO Cloud Account with TIBCO Cloud Messaging subscription.\nObtain the channel URL and one Authentication key.\nDetails Check the script InteractionEventPublisher attached to the object.\nNext Steps Receiving and sending messages is a very powerful capability to implement the business logic of your application outside the Unity code. In an other sample we will show how to use a rule engine (based on complex event processing capabilities offered by TIBCO Cloud Events) to detect some interaction patterns and udpate the scene.\nMessaging can also be used for inter application communication scenario.\nWe will also add events to the InteractionEventPublisher.

Use cases are varied, but often fall into three categories:\n Customer experience (common examples include advertising, product guidance, and gaming) Training (for specific physical tasks like equipment maintenance) Productivity (for actions that can be assisted by virtual information like walking through a museum, reacting in an emergency, or finding the fastest route through the airport)  In all cases, and especially for training and productivity-related scenarios, AR/XR allows both historical and real-time enterprise data to be delivered, consumed and presented to the user in new ways that increase the value of the data. Information may be displayed as holograms to enrich the real environment, and all this is completely and automatically handsfree, and can even include voice control.\nTo showcase the possibilities, TIBCO LABS is exploring and demonstrating how TIBCO Cloud™ capabilities can facilitate and simplify building AR/XR applications.
