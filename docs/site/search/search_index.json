The Scene contains all Charts provided here, plus a Scene Description Panel, and some Scene Decoration Assets.

In case you like to render the charts without the transparent boxes surround, just disable the \u2018Mesh Renderer\u2019 inside Unity3D Inspector and the chart will render without the box surround. Bar Chart Generates multiple Bars with the scaled Box surround, it will automatically be extended if there are more than tow Bars and gets smaller in case there is only one Bar to display.
