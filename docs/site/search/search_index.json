The Implementation is based on standard UnityWebSocket and is working in Unity3D Editor, and on Hololens (UWP). Once connected, the application can subscribe and receive real-time messages and update the scene accordingly. The Package contains a simple sample Implementation that demonstrates how to display the received data in a Scene TextMesh.
